# MCP

The same operations over MCP as over HTTP. Both surfaces call one Action, so they cannot drift — an arch test fails if an Action has no MCP tool.

```php
// config/keystone.php — both transports ship disabled
'mcp' => [
    'web' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'route' => 'mcp/keystone',
        'middleware' => ['auth:api'],
    ],
    'local' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'handle' => 'keystone',
    ],
],
```

**Add auth middleware to the web transport before enabling it.** The tools change the catalog every product depends on.

With `keystone.authorization` on, each tool acts as the authenticated user and checks the same policy ability as its HTTP endpoint; a denied call answers `Unauthorized.`.

## Tools

The server lists two entry points, `search_tools` and `execute_tools`, and keeps the Keystone tools behind them, so a client loads only the schemas it searches for:

```json
{ "calls": [{ "name": "list-attributes-tool", "arguments": {"type": "select"} }] }
```

| `start-import-tool` | Import products from an asset or URL (with jayi/impex) |
| `start-export-tool` | Export products matching a search to a file asset (with jayi/impex) |

Records are addressed by code: `group`, `attribute`, `option`, `family`, `family_variant`, `product_model`, `owner_type`, `owner`, `category`, `asset`, `locale` and `channel` arguments take codes. `show-product-tool`, `show-product-model-tool` and `list-products-tool` take `scope` and `locales` to return one channel's values; `product` takes an identifier. Catalog rule violations come back as errors with a message an agent can act on.

The catalog is `KeystoneServer::TOOLS`.

## Cortex

When `jayi/cortex` is installed and loaded, the server is registered with Cortex under `keystone.cortex.server` and every tool joins its tool registry, tagged with the server name. Cortex can then serve published overrides of the server instructions and of each tool's description.

```php
'cortex' => [
    'enabled' => true,
    'server' => 'keystone',
    'tools' => ['list-attributes-tool', 'show-attribute-tool'], // or null for all
],
```
